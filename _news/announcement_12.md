I'm excited to share SAM 3, a unified model that enables detection, segmentation and tracking of objects across images and videos. SAM 3 introduces some of our most requested features like using text and exemplar prompts to segment all objects of a target category. We released both the model weights and a new open-vocab detection, segmentation and tracking benchmark with permissive license.

Try it out:

Thanks to all collaborators and contributors on this project.
