Llama 3 was released and open-sourced. I'm proud to be a core contributor to Llama 3 and to have led the visual grounding effort. We implemented state-of-the-art input-side visual grounding capabilities in Llama 3. Under the anonymous name "OV-Grounding", Llama 3 is the first model to reach human performance on the Visual Commonsense Reasoning leaderboard.
