Here are three updates on our recent vision-and-language work:

1. Our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03857">Grounded Language–Image Pre-training</a>, was a Best Paper Finalist at CVPR 2022.
2. Our <a href="https://vlp-tutorial.github.io/">CVPR 2022 tutorial</a> will take place on June 19, 2022.
3. We are organizing the ECCV 2022 workshop "Computer Vision in the Wild" — see the workshop site: <a href="https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/eccv-2022/">Computer Vision in the Wild — ECCV 2022</a>. The workshop includes two challenges: Image Classification in the Wild and Object Detection in the Wild. The challenge setup and baselines are described in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08790">ELEVATER benchmark paper</a>. Stay tuned for more details.
